Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = None
        count = 0
        for num in nums:
            if not count:
                ans = num
            if ans == num:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
        return ans
``` 

# Approach : Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
## Intuition
If we had some way of counting instances of the majority element as +1
and instances of any other element as −1, summing them would make it
obvious that the majority element is indeed the majority element.

## Algorithm
Essentially, what Boyer-Moore does is look for a suffix suf of nums
where suf[0] is the majority element in that suffix. To do this, we
maintain a count, which is incremented whenever we see an instance of our current candidate for majority element and decremented whenever we see anything else. Whenever count equals 0, we effectively forget about everything in nums up to the current index and consider the current number as the candidate for majority element.
