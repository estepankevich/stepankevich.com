You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
        dp = [(amount + 1)] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, len(dp)):
            for coin in coins:
                if i-coin < 0:
                    continue
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-coin] + 1)
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] < (amount + 1) else -1
```
