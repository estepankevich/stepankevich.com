Given the array `favoriteCompanies` where `favoriteCompanies[i]` is the list of favorites companies for the `ith` person (**indexed from 0**).

_Return the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a **subset** of any other list of favorites companies_. You must return the indices in increasing order.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def peopleIndexes(self, favoriteCompanies):
        """
        :type favoriteCompanies: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        hashes = [set(person) for person in favoriteCompanies]
        ans = list(range(len(favoriteCompanies)))
        for i, p1 in enumerate(hashes):
            for p2 in hashes:
                if p1 == p2 or len(p2) < len(p1):
                    continue
                if not p1 < p2:
                    continue
                else:
                    ans.remove(i)
                    break
        return ans
```
