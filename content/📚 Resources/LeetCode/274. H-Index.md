Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

# Idea:
Order by descending and counter
```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
       citations.sort(reverse=True)
       counter = 0
       h = 0
       for c in citations:
            counter += 1
            h = max(h, min(c, counter))
       return h
```
