Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_ **_substring_**  _of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

# Idea
Sliding window for filtered characters, update when all char numbers are at least equal to frequency of the initial string

# Code 
```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if not t or not s or len(t) > len(s):
            return ""
        
        count_t = Counter(t)
        
        # Pre-check for validity of `t` in `s`
        if not count_t.keys() <= set(s):
            return ""
        
        # Filter relevant characters from `s`
        filtered_s = [(c, i) for i, c in enumerate(s) if c in count_t]
        
        len_filtered = len(filtered_s)
        len_t = len(count_t)
        if len_filtered < len(t):
            return ""
        
        chars_ok = 0
        count_s = Counter()
        start = 0
        i = 0
        min_len = float(inf)
        ans = (0, -1)

        while i < len_filtered:
            c = filtered_s[i][0]
            count_s[c] += 1
            
            # Check if current character satisfies `t` requirements
            if count_s[c] == count_t[c]:
                chars_ok += 1
            
            # If all characters are satisfied
            while chars_ok == len_t:
                start_char = filtered_s[start][0]
                
                # Update minimum window
                start_idx, end_idx = filtered_s[start][1], filtered_s[i][1]
                if end_idx - start_idx < min_len:
                    ans = (start_idx, end_idx)
                    min_len = end_idx - start_idx
                
                # Shrink the window
                count_s[start_char] -= 1
                if count_s[start_char] < count_t[start_char]:
                    chars_ok -= 1
                start += 1

            i += 1
        
        return s[ans[0]:ans[1] + 1] if min_len != float(inf) else ""
