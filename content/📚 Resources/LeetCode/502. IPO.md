# Description
Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return _the final maximized capital_.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

# Idea 
- Use heap and greedy approach
# Code
```python
class Solution:    
    def findMaximizedCapital(self, k: int, w: int, profits: List[int], capital: List[int]) -> int:
        projects = sorted(zip(capital, profits), reverse=True)
        available = []
        
        while k > 0:
            while projects and projects[-1][0] <= w:
                heappush(available, -projects.pop()[1])
            if not available:
                break
            w -= heappop(available)
            k -= 1
            
        return w
```
