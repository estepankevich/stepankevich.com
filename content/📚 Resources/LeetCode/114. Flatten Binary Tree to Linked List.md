# Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always `null`.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a [**pre-order** **traversal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order,_NLR) of the binary tree.
- **Follow up:** Can you flatten the tree in-place (with `O(1)` extra space)?
# Idea 
## ## Simple solution with `O(n)` memory
Recursive pre-order traversal with appending to the list  and then iterate and set links
## Morris traversal for `O(1)` memory
In a pre-order traversal of a binary tree, each vertex is processed in (node, left, right) order. This means that the entire left subtree could be placed between the node and its right subtree.

To do this, however, we'll first have to locate the last node in the left subtree. This is easy enough, since we know that the last node of a pre-order tree can be found by moving right as many times as possible from its root.

So we should be able to move through the binary tree, keeping track of the curent node (curr). Whenever we find a left subtree, we can dispatch a runner to find its last node, then stitch together both ends of the left subtree into the right path of curr, taking heed to sever the left connection at curr.

# Code
## Simple solution with `O(n)` memory
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        if not root:
            return
            
        elems = []
        def traverse(node):
            elems.append(node)
            if node.left:
                traverse(node.left)
            if node.right:
                traverse(node.right)
        traverse(root)
        for i in range(len(elems)-1):
            elems[i].left = None
            elems[i].right = elems[i+1]
```

## Morris traversal
```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        curr = root
        while curr:
            if curr.left:  # Check if the current node has a left child.
                # Find the rightmost node in the left subtree.
                runner = curr.left
                while runner.right:
                    runner = runner.right

                # Relink the rightmost node of the left subtree to the right subtree.
                runner.right = curr.right

                # Move the left subtree to the right and set the left to None.
                curr.right = curr.left
                curr.left = None

            # Move to the next node in the "linked list" formed by the right pointers.
            curr = curr.right
```
