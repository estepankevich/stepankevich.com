Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

_Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value_
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children
"""

class Solution(object):
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Node
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root:
            return 0
        depth = 1
        children = root.children
        next_children = list([])

        while children:
            depth += 1
            next_children = []
            for c in children:
                next_children.extend(c.children)
            children = next_children

        return depth
```
