You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array `days`. Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in **three different ways**:

- a **1-day** pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars,
- a **7-day** pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars, and
- a **30-day** pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

- For example, if we get a **7-day** pass on day `2`, then we can travel for `7` days: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `8`.

Return _the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days_.
```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        max_day = max(days)
        days_set = set(days)
        dp = [float('inf')] * (max_day + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, max_day + 1):
            if not i in days_set:
                dp[i] = dp[i-1]
            else:
                dp[i] = min(
                    dp[i-1] + costs[0], 
                    dp[max(0,i-7)] + costs[1],
                    dp[max(0,i-30)] + costs[2])

        return dp[max_day]
```
