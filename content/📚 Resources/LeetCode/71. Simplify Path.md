You are given an _absolute_ path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash `'/'`. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its **simplified canonical path**.

The _rules_ of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

- A single period `'.'` represents the current directory.
- A double period `'..'` represents the previous/parent directory.
- Multiple consecutive slashes such as `'//'` and `'///'` are treated as a single slash `'/'`.
- Any sequence of periods that does **not match** the rules above should be treated as a **valid directory or** **file** **name**. For example, `'...'` and `'....'` are valid directory or file names.

The simplified canonical path should follow these _rules_:

- The path must start with a single slash `'/'`.
- Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash `'/'`.
- The path must not end with a slash `'/'`, unless it is the root directory.
- The path must not have any single or double periods (`'.'` and `'..'`) used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the **simplified canonical path**.

# Idea:
Use stack
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = deque()
        for s in path.split("/"):
            if not s:
                continue
            if s == "..":
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
                continue
            if s == ".":
                continue
            stack.append(s)
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```
