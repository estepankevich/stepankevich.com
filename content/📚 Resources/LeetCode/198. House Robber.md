You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) < 3:
            return max(nums)

        dp = [0] * len(nums)
        dp[0] = nums[0]

        for i in range(1, len(dp)):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i-1])
        
        return dp[-1]
```
