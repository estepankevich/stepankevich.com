Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

# Idea: Bit Manipulation
- If we take XOR of zero and some bit, it will return that bit
    - a⊕0=a
- If we take XOR of two same bits, it will return 0
    - a⊕a=0
- a⊕b⊕a=(a⊕a)⊕b=0⊕b=b
So we can XOR all bits together to find the unique number.
# Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a = 0
        for i in nums:
            a ^= i
        return a
```
