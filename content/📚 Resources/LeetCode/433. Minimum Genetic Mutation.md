# Description
A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string `startGene` to a gene string `endGene` where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.

- For example, `"AACCGGTT" --> "AACCGGTA"` is one mutation.

There is also a gene bank `bank` that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in `bank` to make it a valid gene string.

Given the two gene strings `startGene` and `endGene` and the gene bank `bank`, return _the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from_ `startGene` _to_ `endGene`. If there is no such a mutation, return `-1`.

Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.

# Idea 
- BFS in graph
# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minMutation(self, startGene: str, endGene: str, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        if startGene == endGene and startGene in bank:
            return 0
        if not bank or endGene not in bank:
            return -1

        adj = defaultdict(set)

        def distance(s1, s2):
            counter = 0
            for i in range(len(s1)):
                if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                    counter += 1
            return counter

        for s1 in bank:
            for s2 in bank:
                if s1 != s2 and distance(s1, s2) == 1:
                    adj[s1].add(s2)
                    adj[s2].add(s1)

        visited = set(s for s in bank if distance(s, startGene) == 1)
        queue = deque(visited)
        step = 0
        
        while queue:
            step += 1
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                curr = queue.popleft()
                
                if curr == endGene:
                    return step

                for neighbour in adj[curr]:
                    if neighbour not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbour)
                        queue.append(neighbour)

        return -1
```
