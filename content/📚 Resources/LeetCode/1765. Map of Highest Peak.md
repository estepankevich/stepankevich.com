You are given an integer matrix `isWater` of size `m x n` that represents a map of **land** and **water** cells.

- If `isWater[i][j] == 0`, cell `(i, j)` is a **land** cell.
- If `isWater[i][j] == 1`, cell `(i, j)` is a **water** cell.

You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:

- The height of each cell must be non-negative.
- If the cell is a **water** cell, its height must be `0`.
- Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of **at most** `1`. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).

Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is **maximized**.

Return _an integer matrix_ `height` _of size_ `m x n` _where_ `height[i][j]` _is cell_ `(i, j)`_'s height. If there are multiple solutions, return **any** of them_.

# Idea
BFS 

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def highestPeak(self, isWater: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        N, M = len(isWater), len(isWater[0])
        queue = deque()

        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(M):
                if isWater[i][j] == 1:
                    isWater[i][j] = 0
                    queue.append((i, j))
                else:
                    isWater[i][j] = None
        
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
        height = 0
        
        while queue:
            height += 1
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                x, y = queue.popleft()
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < M and isWater[nx][ny] is None:
                        isWater[nx][ny] = height
                        queue.append((nx, ny))
                    
        return isWater
