Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.
```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        first, second = dummy, dummy
        # Advances first pointer so that the gap between first and second is n nodes apart
        for i in range(n + 1):
            first = first.next
        # Move first to the end, maintaining the gap
        while first is not None:
            first = first.next
            second = second.next
        second.next = second.next.next
        return dummy.next
```
