You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 2:
            return 1
            
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 2

        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

        return dp[n-1]
```
