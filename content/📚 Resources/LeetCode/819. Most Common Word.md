Given a string `paragraph` and a string array of the banned words `banned`, return _the most frequent word that is not banned_. It is **guaranteed** there is **at least one word** that is not banned, and that the answer is **unique**.

The words in `paragraph` are **case-insensitive** and the answer should be returned in **lowercase**.
```python
import re

class Solution(object):
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph, banned):
        """
        :type paragraph: str
        :type banned: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        paragraph = paragraph.lower()
        words_dict = {}
        words = [w for w in re.split(r"[!?',;. ]+", paragraph) if w and w not in banned]
        for w in words:
            words_dict[w] = words_dict.get(w, 0) + 1

        return max(words_dict, key=words_dict.get)
```
