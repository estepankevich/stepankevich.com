# Description
You are given a **0-indexed** 2D array `grid` of size `2 x n`, where `grid[r][c]` represents the number of points at position `(r, c)` on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.

Both robots initially start at `(0, 0)` and want to reach `(1, n-1)`. Each robot may only move to the **right** (`(r, c)` to `(r, c + 1)`) or **down** (`(r, c)` to `(r + 1, c)`).

At the start of the game, the **first** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells `(r, c)` traversed on the path, `grid[r][c]` is set to `0`. Then, the **second** robot moves from `(0, 0)` to `(1, n-1)`, collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.

The **first** robot wants to **minimize** the number of points collected by the **second** robot. In contrast, the **second** robot wants to **maximize** the number of points it collects. If both robots play **optimally**, return _the **number of points** collected by the **second** robot._
# Idea 
Prefix and Suffix Sum sum. at every step update minmax value, pay attention to the boundaries
# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def gridGame(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        first_row_sum = sum(grid[0])
        second_row_sum = 0
        minimum_sum = float("inf")
        for turn_index in range(len(grid[0])):
            first_row_sum -= grid[0][turn_index]
            # Find the minimum maximum value out of first_row_sum and
            # second_row_sum.
            minimum_sum = min(minimum_sum, max(first_row_sum, second_row_sum))
            second_row_sum += grid[1][turn_index]
        return minimum_sum
