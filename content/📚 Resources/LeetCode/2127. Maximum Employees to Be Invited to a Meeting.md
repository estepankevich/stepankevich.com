# Description
A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of `n` employees, waiting to be invited. They have arranged for a large **circular** table, capable of seating **any number** of employees.

The employees are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each employee has a **favorite** person and they will attend the meeting **only if** they can sit next to their favorite person at the table. The favorite person of an employee is **not** themself.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `favorite`, where `favorite[i]` denotes the favorite person of the `ith` employee, return _the **maximum number of employees** that can be invited to the meeting_.

# Idea 
[Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-employees-to-be-invited-to-a-meeting/solutions/6329874/scenario-analysis-topological-sorting-cycle-detection-with-example/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-01-26) proposed by [Shubham Baban Shinde](https://leetcode.com/u/shubham6762/)
### **1. Large Cycles (Size >2)**
**Example:**  
A → B → C → A (cycle of 3)  
**Explanation:**
- Each person must sit next to their favorite.
- Seating: A next to B, B next to C, C next to A (circular).
- All 3 can attend.  
    **Result:**  
    Maximum invitations = cycle length (3).
### **2. Mutual Pairs (Cycle of 2) with Chains**
**Example:**  
A ↔ B (mutual favorites), with chains:  
C → A and D → E → B  
**Explanation:**
- A and B sit together.
- Chain C → A adds 1 person (C sits next to A).
- Chain D → E → B adds 2 people (D next to E, E next to B).  
    **Seating:** C-A-B-E-D (circular).  
    **Result:**  
    Total = 2 (pair) + 1 (C) + 2 (D,E) = 5.

### **Why Cycle Length 2 is Special**
- **Mutual pairs** (A ↔ B) allow combining two independent chains.
- Larger cycles (like A→B→C→A) can't add external people—every seat is already taken by cycle members.

### **Key Code Steps Explained**
1. **Track Dependencies (`inDeg`):**
    - Count how many employees favor each person.
    - Example: If B is favorited by A and C, `inDeg[B] = 2`.
2. **Process Chains (Queue):**
    - Employees with `inDeg = 0` start chains (e.g., C in C→A).
    - Propagate chain lengths (e.g., C→A increases A's chain length to 1).
3. **Detect Cycles:**
    - Unvisited employees after chain processing form cycles.
    - For cycles of 2 (A ↔ B), add both employees plus their chains.
    - For larger cycles, track the longest one.
4. **Final Decision:**
    - Compare the largest cycle size with the sum of all mutual pairs and their chains.

    def maximumInvitations(self, favorite):
        n = len(favorite)

        visited = [False] * n
        q = deque()
        
        # Count how many people favor each employee
        for f in favorite:
            in_deg[f] += 1
        
        # Start with employees no one favorites (chain starters)
        for i in range(n):
            if in_deg[i] == 0:
                q.append(i)
        
        # Process chains to calculate max chain lengths
        while q:
            u = q.popleft()
            visited[u] = True
            v = favorite[u]
            chain_len[v] = max(chain_len[v], chain_len[u] + 1)
            in_deg[v] -= 1
            if in_deg[v] == 0:
                q.append(v)
        
        max_cycle, pair_chains = 0, 0
        
        # Detect cycles and calculate results
        for i in range(n):
            if visited[i]:
                continue
            cycle_len = 0
            current = i
            # Measure cycle length
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = favorite[current]
                cycle_len += 1
            if cycle_len == 2:  # Mutual pair
                pair_chains += 2 + chain_len[i] + chain_len[favorite[i]]
            else:
                max_cycle = max(max_cycle, cycle_len)
        
        return max(max_cycle, pair_chains)
