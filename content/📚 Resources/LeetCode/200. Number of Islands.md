Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

# Idea
Depth search
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
  #      visited = set()

        N = len(grid)
        if not N:
            return 0
        M = len(grid[0])
        if not M:
            return 0

        def searchFromCell(i: int, j: int, island_id: int): 
            if grid[i][j] != "1":
                return

            grid[i][j] = island_id
            
            if i > 0:
                searchFromCell(i-1, j, island_id)
            if i < N - 1:
                searchFromCell(i+1, j, island_id)
            if j > 0:
                searchFromCell(i, j-1, island_id)
            if j < M - 1:
                searchFromCell(i, j+1, island_id)

        island_id = 1
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    island_id += 1
                    searchFromCell(i, j, island_id)
        
        return island_id - 1

```
