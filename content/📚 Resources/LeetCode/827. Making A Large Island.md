# Description
You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`. You are allowed to change **at most one** `0` to be `1`.

Return _the size of the largest **island** in_ `grid` _after applying this operation_.

An **island** is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s.

# Idea 
1. Find and label islands using DFS, calculating their sizes and marking border cells adjacent to water
2. Store border cell contributions: Each `0` cell is mapped to the islands it connects to
3. If the grid is fully land, return its total size. If no islands exist, return `1` (by flipping any `0`)
4. Simulate flipping a `0`: The new island area is `1 + sum(connected island sizes)`
5. Return the maximum possible island size

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def largestIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
        visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]

        def dfs(x: int, y: int, border_cells: set) -> int:
            visited[x][y] = True
            area = 1

            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny]:
                    if grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                        border_cells.add((nx, ny)) 
                    else:
                        area += dfs(nx, ny, border_cells)

            return area

        # Dictionary to store possible expansions for each border cell
        border_areas = defaultdict(list)

        # Step 1: Identify islands and associate their areas with border cells
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                    border_cells = set()
                    island_area = dfs(i, j, border_cells)

                    # If the entire grid is one big island, return its area
                    if not border_cells:
                        return island_area

                    # Store island areas mapped to border cells
                    for cell in border_cells:
                        border_areas[cell].append(island_area)

        # No islands exist, flipping any '0' creates an island of size 1
        if not border_areas: 
            return 1 if rows and cols else 0

        # For every flipped border cell the area will be 1 + sum of connected islands
        return max(1 + sum(areas) for areas in border_areas.values())
