# Description
You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

# Idea 
- Dynamic Programming
# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        if grid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0

        grid[0][0] = 1 
        for i in range(0, rows):
            for j in range(0, cols):
                if not i == j == 0:
                    if grid[i][j] == 1:
                        grid[i][j] = 0
                    else:
                        if i > 0:
                            grid[i][j] += grid[i-1][j]
                        if j > 0:
                            grid[i][j] += grid[i][j-1]
        
        return grid[-1][-1]
```
