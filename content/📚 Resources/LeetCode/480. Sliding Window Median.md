The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle values.

- For examples, if `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
- For examples, if `arr = [1,2,3,4]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. There is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return _the median array for each window in the original array_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual value will be accepted.
```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def medianSlidingWindow(self, nums, k):
        # Two heaps: small (max-heap), large (min-heap)
        small, large = [], []
        
        # Initialize the first window
        for i, x in enumerate(nums[:k]):
            heapq.heappush(small, (-x, i))
        
        # Balance the heaps: ensure large has at least (k//2) elements
        for _ in range(k - (k // 2)):
            self.move(small, large)
        
        # Store the medians
        result = [self.get_median(small, large, k)]
        
        # Process the sliding window
        for i, x in enumerate(nums[k:], start=k):
            # Add the new element to the appropriate heap
            if x >= large[0][0]:
                heapq.heappush(large, (x, i))
                if nums[i - k] <= large[0][0]:
                    self.move(large, small)
            else:

                if nums[i - k] >= large[0][0]:
                    self.move(small, large)
            
            # Remove elements outside the current window
            while small and small[0][1] <= i - k:
                heapq.heappop(small)
            while large and large[0][1] <= i - k:
                heapq.heappop(large)
            
            # Append the current median
            result.append(self.get_median(small, large, k))
        
        return result

    def move(self, source_heap, target_heap):

        value, index = heapq.heappop(source_heap)

    def get_median(self, small, large, k):

### Code Explanation

This code calculates the **median of a sliding window** of size `k` over the input list `nums`. 

#### 1. **Two Heaps** (`small` and `large`)
- The algorithm uses **two heaps**:
  - `small`: A max-heap (simulated using a min-heap with negative values).
  - `large`: A min-heap.
- Together, they partition the sliding window such that:
  - `small` contains the smaller half of the numbers (as negatives for max-heap behavior).
  - `large` contains the larger half of the numbers.

#### 2. **Initial Window Setup**
- The first `k` elements of `nums` are pushed into the `small` heap.
- To balance the heaps, elements are moved from `small` to `large` until `large` contains at least `k/2` elements (for even `k`) or one extra element for odd `k`.

#### 3. **Sliding Window Processing**
- As the window slides through `nums`, the algorithm:
  1. Adds the next number to one of the heaps, depending on its value relative to the current median.
  2. Moves an element between heaps if necessary to maintain balance.
  3. Removes outdated elements (outside the current window) from the heaps.
  4. Computes the median after each step and appends it to the result list.

#### 4. **Helper Functions**
- `move(h1, h2)`: Moves the top element from heap `h1` to `h2`. Adjusts signs for maintaining the max-heap in `small`.
- `get_med(h1, h2, k)`: Computes the median based on the top elements of the heaps.
