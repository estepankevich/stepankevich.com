You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(cost) < 2:
            return min(cost)

        dp = [0] * (len(cost) + 1)
        for i in range(2, len(cost)+1):
            dp[i] = min(
                dp[i-1] + cost[i-1], 
                dp[i-2] + cost[i-2]
            )
        return dp.pop()
```
