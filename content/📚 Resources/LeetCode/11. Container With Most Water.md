You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.
**Example 1:**

**Input:** height = \[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7\]
**Output:** 49
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array \[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7\]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
# Idea 
Two pointers and proof that it is the optimal solution

# Code 
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(height) < 2:
            return 0
        i = 0
        j = len(height) - 1

        ans = 0

        while i < j:
            ans = max(ans, min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i))
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else: 
                j -= 1
        
        return ans

```
