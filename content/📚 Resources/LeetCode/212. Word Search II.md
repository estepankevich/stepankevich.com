# Description
Given an `m x n` `board` of characters and a list of strings `words`, return _all words on the board_.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where **adjacent cells** are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
# **Intuition**
The Trie data structure allows for efficient prefix-based searching, reducing unnecessary traversals. Backtracking explores all possible paths on the board to match words.
# **Approach**
1. **Construct a Trie**: Build a Trie from the given list of words, where each node represents a character and stores the full word at the end of a valid path.
2. **Backtracking**:
    - For each cell in the board, check if it starts a word in the Trie.
    - Recursively explore its neighbors while marking visited cells to avoid revisits.
    - Add matched words to the result set and terminate paths that cannot yield further valid words.

    def findWords(self, board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        n, m = len(board), len(board[0])
        directions = [[0,1],[0,-1],[1,0],[-1,0]]
        trie = {}
        for word in words:
            pointer = trie
            for char in word:
                if char not in pointer:
                    pointer[char] = {}
                pointer = pointer[char]
            pointer['$'] = word

        def backtrack(trie, used, i, j):
            if '$' in trie:
                ans.add(trie['$'])
                if len(trie) == 1:
                    return
            for dx, dy in directions:
                x, y = i + dx, j + dy
                if (x, y) in used or not (0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m) or board[x][y] not in trie:
                    continue
                used.add((x, y))
                backtrack(trie[board[x][y]], used, x, y)
                used.remove((x, y))

        ans = set()
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                # All words are found
                if len(ans) == len(words):
                    break
                if not board[i][j] in trie:
                    continue
                backtrack(trie[board[i][j]], {(i, j)}, i, j)

        return list(ans)
