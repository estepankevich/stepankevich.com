Given a non-negative integer `x`, return _the square root of_ `x` _rounded down to the nearest integer_. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

You **must not use** any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.
# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x < 2:
            return x

        y0 = x
        y1 = (y0 + x / y0) / 2
        while abs(y0 - y1) >= 1:
            y0 = y1
            y1 = (y0 + float(x) / y0) / 2

        return int(y1)
``` 
# Explanation:

### **1. Problem Setup**  
We aim to compute the square root of a number $x$, denoted $\sqrt{x}$. This can be formulated as solving the equation:  
$$  
f(y) = y^2 - x = 0  
$$  
The solution $y$ to this equation satisfies $y = \sqrt{x}$.

### **2. [[Newton's Method]]**  
Newton's method is an iterative algorithm for finding roots of a differentiable function $f(y) = 0$. The iteration formula is:  
$$  
y_{n+1} = y_n - \frac{f(y_n)}{f'(y_n)}  
$$  
where:  
- $y_n$ is the current estimate of the root,  
- $f'(y)$ is the derivative of $f(y)$.  

### **3. Applying to $f(y) = y^2 - x$**  
For $f(y) = y^2 - x$:  
$$  
f'(y) = 2y  
$$  
Substituting $f(y)$ and $f'(y)$ into the formula:  
$$  
y_{n+1} = y_n - \frac{y_n^2 - x}{2y_n}  
$$  
Simplify:  
$$  
y_{n+1} = \frac{2y_n - \frac{y_n^2 - x}{y_n}}{2}  
$$  
$$  
y_{n+1} = \frac{y_n + \frac{x}{y_n}}{2}  
$$

This gives the iterative formula:  
$$  
y_{n+1} = \frac{y_n + \frac{x}{y_n}}{2}  
$$

### **4. Initial Guess**  
The initial guess $y0 = x$ is chosen because $\sqrt{x}$ lies between $0$ and $x$ for $x > 1$, making $x$ a reasonable starting point.
