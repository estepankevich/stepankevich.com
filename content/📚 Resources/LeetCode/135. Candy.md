There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.
```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        candies = [1 for _ in range(len(ratings))]

        for i in range(1, len(ratings)):
            if ratings[i-1] < ratings[i] and candies[i-1] >= candies[i]:
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1

        for i in range(len(ratings)-2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1] and candies[i] <= candies[i + 1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i + 1] + 1
                
        return sum(candies) 
```
