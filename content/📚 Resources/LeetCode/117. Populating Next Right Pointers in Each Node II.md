# Description
Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Follow-up:**
- You may only use constant extra space.
- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

# Idea 
Once we are done establishing the `next` pointers between the nodes, don't they kind of represent a linked list? After the `next` connections are established, all the nodes on a particular level actually form a linked list via these `next` pointers. Based on this idea, we have the following intuition for our space efficient algorithm:

> We only move on to the level N+1 when we are done establishing the next pointers for the level N. So, since we have access to all the nodes on a particular level via the next pointers, we can use these next pointers to establish the connections for the next level or the level containing their children.
# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root:
            return None

        dummy=Node(0)        
        head=root        

        while head:
            curr=head # initialize current level's head
            prev=dummy # init prev for next level linked list traversal
			# iterate through the linked-list of the current level and connect all the siblings in the next level
            while curr:  
                if curr.left:
                    prev.next=curr.left
                    prev=prev.next
                if curr.right:
                    prev.next=curr.right
                    prev=prev.next                                                
                curr=curr.next
            head=dummy.next # update head to the linked list of next level
            dummy.next=None # reset dummy node
        return root
```
