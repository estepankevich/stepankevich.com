There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return _the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons_.
# Ides
Sort and iterate from left to right 
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not points:
            return 0
        
        # sort by x_end
        points.sort(key = lambda x : x[1])
        
        arrows = 1
        first_end = points[0][1]
        for x_start, x_end in points:
            # if the current balloon starts after the end of another one,
            # one needs one more arrow
            if first_end < x_start:
                arrows += 1
                first_end = x_end
        
        return arrows
```
