Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

- Operation 1: Swap any two **existing** characters.
    - For example, `abcde -> aecdb`
- Operation 2: Transform **every** occurrence of one **existing** character into another **existing** character, and do the same with the other character.
    - For example, `aacabb -> bbcbaa` (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and all `b`'s turn into `a`'s)

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` _if_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _are **close**, and_ `false` _otherwise._
```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        count1 = Counter(word1)
        count2 = Counter(word2)
        return (sorted(count1.values()) == sorted(count2.values()) and 
            count1.keys() == count2.keys())
```
