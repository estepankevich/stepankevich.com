You are starving and you want to eat food as quickly as possible. You want to find the shortest path to arrive at any food cell.

You are given an `m x n` character matrix, `grid`, of these different types of cells:

- `'*'` is your location. There is **exactly one** `'*'` cell.
- `'#'` is a food cell. There may be **multiple** food cells.
- `'O'` is free space, and you can travel through these cells.
- `'X'` is an obstacle, and you cannot travel through these cells.

You can travel to any adjacent cell north, east, south, or west of your current location if there is not an obstacle.

Return _the **length** of the shortest path for you to reach **any** food cell_. If there is no path for you to reach food, return `-1`.

# Idea
BFS and track visited
```python
class Solution:
    def getFood(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        N = len(grid)
        M = len(grid[0])
        visited = [[False] * M for _ in range(N)]
        nodes = deque([next((i,j) for i in range(N) for j in range(M) if grid[i][j] == '*')])
        
        steps = 0
        while nodes:
            steps += 1
            for i in range(len(nodes)):
                n = nodes.popleft()
                for dx,dy in [
                        (n[0]-1,n[1]), 
                        (n[0]+1, n[1]),
                        (n[0], n[1]-1),
                        (n[0], n[1]+1)]:
                    if dx < 0 or dx >= N or dy < 0 or dy >= M or visited[dx][dy]:
                        continue
                    val = grid[dx][dy]
                    visited[dx][dy] = True
                    if val == '#':
                        return steps
                    if val == 'O':
                        nodes.append((dx, dy))
        return -1
                    
                        

```
