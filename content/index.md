      My name is Evgeny. I’m passionate about data science, mathematics, and philosophy. 
      <br/> <br/>
      This site is a collection of my blog posts, notes, and projects I’ve worked on or found inspiring over the years. What started as a simple digital repository has evolved into a multilingual mix of English, French, and Russian content. I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity or inspires your own explorations.
      <br/> <br/>
      In my free time I enjoy running🏃, climbing🧗, and playing the piano🎹.
